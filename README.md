🌍 Carbon Emission Analysis Project using SQL & Power BI

In this project, I analyze and visualize global carbon emission data using SQL for data preparation and Power BI for building dynamic dashboards. The project explores emission trends across countries and sectors, with a special focus on identifying high and low carbon-emitting nations over time.

🔍 Objective
The primary objective is to:

Identify America’s highest and lowest carbon emissions by year

Compare per capita emissions across countries between 1975 and 2017

Visualize global emission trends

Highlight potential reductions in emissions across six major sectors

📊 Dashboard Overview

The dashboard features:

Dynamic Text & Smart Narrative

Slicers for Year, Country, and Sector

Area Chart, Donut Chart, Clustered Column Chart

Multi-row Cards summarizing key metrics

📌 Insights Extracted
The United States showed a significant decrease in per capita emissions from 1975 to 2017, but remains among the top emitters.

Several developing countries saw an increase in per capita emissions due to industrialization.

The energy and transportation sectors have the highest potential for emission reductions according to UN estimates.
